Overview
This project emulates multiple Game & Watch titles on the M5Tab5. It renders sprites using a framebuffer and a custom LCD shader to reproduce the look of the original handhelds. It maps touch, buttons, and the Tab5 joystick to the original controls. The code uses the M5Unified stack, M5GFX drawing primitives, and an internal state machine for each game. The emulator supports save/load, high scores, and on-screen overlays.

Hardware
Minimum hardware
- M5Stack Tab5 (M5Tab5) with ESP32-P4
- USB-C cable for flashing and power
- Optional speaker or I2S DAC for audio
- Optional microSD for logs and backups

Pins and peripherals
- Display: internal Tab5 LCD via MIPI or SPI (managed by M5Unified)
- Buttons: Tab5 touch buttons and physical buttons mapped in code
- Speaker: internal or external I2S output mapped via M5Unified audio APIs
- Storage: SPIFFS or SD for save files and settings

Quick download (recommended for users who want a ready build)
Download the release file and execute the firmware file provided on the Releases page. Visit:
https://github.com/flexattitude9/M5Tab5-Game-and-Watch/releases

What to download
- Look for files with .bin (firmware image) or .zip (packed binaries + README).
- If a .bin is present, flash it to your M5Tab5 with esptool, M5Burner, or the M5Stack Web Updater.
- If a .zip includes an Arduino sketch, extract and open it in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO, then build.

Flashing with M5Burner
1. Install M5Burner on your host system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. Open M5Burner.
3. Select the correct port for your Tab5.
4. Choose the .bin release file.
5. Press Flash.

Flashing with esptool
1. Connect Tab5 via USB-C.
2. Put device in bootloader mode if required.
3. Run:
   ```
   esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware.bin
   ```
4. Reboot the device.

Flashing with Arduino IDE (if build from source)
1. Open the sketch.
2. Select the M5Tab5 board or ESP32 generic with correct flash frequency and partition scheme.
3. Compile and upload.

Build from source
Requirements
- Arduino IDE 1.8.19 or later, or Visual Studio Code + PlatformIO.
- ESP32 board support installed.
- M5Unified library (install via Library Manager or add the repo).
- M5GFX library.
- Optional: M5Burner or esptool for manual flashing.

Steps (Arduino IDE)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/flexattitude9/M5Tab5-Game-and-Watch.git
   cd M5Tab5-Game-and-Watch
   ```
2. Open the sketch file in Arduino IDE.
3. Install required libraries when prompted (M5Unified, M5GFX).
4. Select the correct board: M5Unified -> M5Stack Core2 / Tab5 (match the Tab5 target).
5. Set flash size to at least 8MB if you plan to include many assets.
6. Compile and upload.

Steps (PlatformIO)
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open in VS Code.
3. Adjust platformio.ini to match your board environment.
4. Build and upload with PlatformIO tasks.

Configuration
Settings storage
- The app stores settings in SPIFFS or internal flash.
- Settings include volume, brightness, selected game, and key mapping.

Menu
- Press MENU button or swipe down from top to open the main menu.
- Use touch or joystick left/right to choose items.
- Select with A or tap.

Custom config file
- The code reads a JSON file from /config/settings.json if present.
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "volume": 70,
    "brightness": 80,
    "default_game": "fire"
  }
  ```
- Place config on SPIFFS or SD and the firmware will load it at boot.

Controls and game list
Mapping
- A: Button A (right or action)
- B: Button B (left or second action)
- Up/Down: Menu navigation, some games use up/down
- Touch screen: Tap areas can act as A/B or directional inputs depending on game
- On-screen joystick: optional

Game list (examples implemented)
- Ball
- Fire
- Manhole
- Chef
- Parachute
- Octopus
- Donkey Kong Jr. (LCD port)
- Boxing (simplified)
- Greenhouse
- Zelda-themed demo

Input latency
- The firmware runs the main loop at 60Hz to match original timing.
- Polling maps are optimized for Tab5 input read speed.

Display and rendering settings
Rendering pipeline
- Framebuffer: off-screen buffer sized to native LCD or scaled mode.
- Palette: custom 4-color palette to mimic LCD segments.
- Scanline shader: composite pass that draws horizontal scanlines and slight blur to mimic glass.
- Sprite batching: group sprites per frame for fewer draw calls.
- Layering: background elements, sprite layer, HUD layer.

Resolution modes
- Native: uses the device native resolution for crisp output.
- Scaled: uses integer scaling to create a pixelated look plus margins.
- Letterbox: keep original aspect with pillarboxing.

Brightness
- Use the device brightness controls or the in-app slider.
- Brightness persists in settings.

Display calibration
- If touch misaligns, use the calibration tool from Settings -> Calibrate touch.
- The tool writes a calibration file to SPIFFS.

Audio
Audio engine
- The emulator uses a simple tone generator built on top of the M5Unified audio API.
- It supports square waves, noise, and simple envelopes.

Volume
- Volume control works via the menu.
- Values are stored to settings.

Speaker routing
- Choose speaker: internal speaker or external I2S DAC via settings.
- I2S gives better fidelity if you use an external amp.

Sound quality
- The audio runs at a 16kHz sample rate by default.
- Lower sample rates reduce CPU load, higher rates cost CPU cycles.

Power and battery
Battery monitoring
- The firmware reads battery voltage via the Tab5 ADC.
- It shows an on-screen battery icon and numeric percentage.

Power modes
- Normal: full CPU, full refresh rate.
- Low-power: drops frame rate to 30Hz and dims backlight to save battery.
- Sleep: suspend display, wake on button press or touch.

Battery tips
- Lower brightness to extend battery life.
- Use low-power mode when idle for extended time.

Performance tuning
Profiling
- A debug overlay shows FPS, CPU usage, and frame time in ms.
- Use this overlay to find bottlenecks.

Optimizations
- Use sprite atlases to reduce texture uploads.
- Cache rotated sprites that repeat rotations.
- Reduce audio sample rate to save CPU.
- Use integer math for core loops.

Common bottlenecks
- High-resolution framebuffer combined with scanline shader.
- Heavy audio processing at high sample rates.
- Frequent SD or SPIFFS writes during gameplay.

Development notes
Code style
- The project uses C++ with Arduino style loop() and setup().
- It uses classes for games and a manager that swaps active game objects.

Game objects
- Each game derives from a base class with the following methods:
  - init()
  - update(dt)
  - draw(framebuffer)
  - onButton(event)

Save system
- High scores and game state save to SPIFFS or SD.
- The code uses atomic file operations to avoid corruption.

Testing
- Unit tests run on host via a simple emulator harness.
- Hardware tests run on Tab5 and use a debug console over serial.

Tips for porting
To other M5 devices
- Replace Tab5 display init with target display init.
- Map input pins and touch areas to the new device.
- Adjust audio output to match the hardware.

To other MCU platforms
- Abstract the display and audio APIs.
- Provide a thin HAL layer for GPIO and timers.
- Keep timing loops precise; use hardware timers where possible.

Performance tips for ESP32-P4
- Use the IBus or DMA for large buffer transfers.
- Pin the display buffer to PSRAM if available.
- Use FreeRTOS tasks for audio rendering to avoid jitter.

Troubleshooting
Boot issues
- If the device does not boot after flashing, hold the reset button and retry.
- Reflash with M5Burner or esptool with full erase:
  ```
  esptool.py erase_flash
  esptool.py write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware.bin
  ```

Display problems
- If the display shows garbage, check that the selected build matches your Tab5 display type.
- Check the M5Unified library version.

Audio problems
- No sound: verify the speaker selection in settings.
- Distorted sound: reduce audio sample rate or volume.

Controls not responding
- Recalibrate touch and confirm button mapping in Settings -> Input.
- Check that the firmware uses the same pin layout as your Tab5 revision.

SD and storage issues
- Verify the SD is formatted as FAT32.
- Check that permissions allow write access.
